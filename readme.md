# 🍏 Apple Clone

This project is a simple clone of the official Apple website, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of this project is to replicate Apple's clean and modern design while practicing web development skills and techniques. The project is fully responsive and closely mimics the design and layout of Apple's homepage.

## 🌟 Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable to various screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Sticky Navigation Bar:** A fixed header that remains at the top of the page as you scroll, similar to Apple’s main navigation.
- **Hero Section:** Highlighting Apple’s key products with high-resolution images and bold typography.
- **Product Sections:** Showcasing the latest Apple products including iPhones, MacBooks, and other devices.
- **Basic JavaScript Interactivity:** A minimal amount of JS used for smooth scrolling, navigation bar dropdowns, and other small UI enhancements.
